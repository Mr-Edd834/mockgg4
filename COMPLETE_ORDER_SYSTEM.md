## 🔄 Complete Order Lifecycle

### 1. **Customer Places Order** (mockgg)
```
Cart (Checkout page) → Fill PlaceOrder form → Click "Pay"
  ↓
Order created in database (status: pending)
  ↓
Cart cleared → Navigate to MyOrders
  ↓
White dot appears on MyOrders icon ⚪
```

### 2. **Admin Sees Order** (GGadmin)
```
New order appears in "Your Orders" page
  ↓
Shows: Accept Order + Reject Order buttons
```

### 3. **Admin Accepts Order** (GGadmin)
```
Admin clicks "Accept Order"
  ↓
Status → "accepted"
  ↓
Green badge shows "Accepted" ✓
  ↓
Button changes to "Order is Complete"
```

**Customer sees:** "Your order is being processed" 🔄 (orange spinner)

### 4. **Admin Completes Order** (GGadmin)
```
Admin clicks "Order is Complete"
  ↓
Status → "on-the-way"
  ↓
Order removed from "Your Orders"
```

**Customer sees:** "Your food is on the way" 🚗 (green truck icon)  
**Shows:** "Order has arrived" button

### 5. **Customer Confirms Arrival** (mockgg)
```
Customer clicks "Order has arrived"
  ↓
Status → "completed"
  ↓
White dot disappears ⚪→❌
```

**Customer sees:** "Your order has arrived" ✓ (green checkmark)

**Admin sees:** Order moves to "Completed Orders" page

### 6. **Rejection Flow** (if rejected)
```
Admin clicks "Reject Order"
  ↓
Status → "rejected"
  ↓
Order removed from "Your Orders"
  ↓
Moves to "Completed Orders"
```

**Customer sees:**
- "Sorry your order couldn't be processed" ❌ (red)
- Card becomes greyed out
- White dot disappears

## 🎨 Status Colors & Icons

### Customer App (mockgg - MyOrders):

| Status | Message | Icon | Color | Dot |
|--------|---------|------|-------|-----|
| **pending** | "Your order is being processed" | Spinner 🔄 | Orange | ⚪ Yes |
| **accepted** | "Your order is being processed" | Spinner 🔄 | Orange | ⚪ Yes |
| **on-the-way** | "Your food is on the way" | Truck 🚗 | Green | ⚪ Yes |
| **completed** | "Your order has arrived" | Checkmark ✓ | Green | ❌ No |
| **rejected** | "Sorry your order couldn't be processed" | X Mark ✗ | Red | ❌ No |

### Admin App (GGadmin - Your Orders):

| Status | Display | Buttons | Badge |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| **pending** | - | Accept + Reject | - |
| **accepted** | Green "Accepted" badge ✓ | Order is Complete | Green |
| **on-the-way** | - | - | Moved to Completed |

---

## 📱 White Dot Notification System

### Mockgg Sidebar - MyOrders Icon:
- **Shows ⚪**: When orders have status: pending, accepted, or on-the-way
- **Hides ❌**: When all orders are completed or rejected
- **Count**: `getPendingOrdersCount()`

### Logic:
```javascript
if (order.status === 'pending' || 'accepted' || 'on-the-way') {
  Show white dot
} else {
  Hide dot
}
```

---

## 🛠️ API Endpoints Created

### Backend Routes (`/api/orders/...`):

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/create` | POST | Create new order |
| `/list` | GET | Get all orders (admin) |
| `/active` | GET | Get pending/accepted/on-the-way orders |
| `/completed` | GET | Get completed/rejected orders |
