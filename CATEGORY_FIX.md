# ✅ FastFood Category Fix

## Issue Found & Resolved

### Problem:
FastFood category items were not displaying because of a **case-sensitivity mismatch**:

- **GGadmin saves as**: `"FastFood"` (capital F in Food)
- **Frontend was filtering for**: `"Fastfood"` (lowercase f in food)

### Solution:
Updated `src/Contexts/storeContext.js` to filter for the correct category name:

```javascript
// Before (WRONG):
const fastFoodMenu = allProducts.filter(product => product.category === "Fastfood");

// After (CORRECT):
const fastFoodMenu = allProducts.filter(product => product.category === "FastFood");
```

---

## ✅ Fixed!

FastFood items will now display correctly in the Fast Feast category page.

---

## 📋 Correct Category Names (Case-Sensitive!)

When adding products in GGadmin, use these exact category values:

| Category Value | Displays In |
|---------------|-------------|
| `DelightMeals` | Delight Meals page |
| `FastFood` | Fast Feast page ⚠️ (Note: Capital F!) |
| `Snacks` | Snack Hub page |
| `GrubMart` | GrubMart page |

---

## 🔍 How to Verify

1. Add a product in GGadmin with category "FastFood"
2. Navigate to Fast Feast page in mockgg
3. Product should now display! ✅

## 💡 Important Note

**Category names are case-sensitive!** Always use the exact spelling and capitalization as shown above when adding products in GGadmin.
