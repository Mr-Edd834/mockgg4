# 🎉 Database Integration - Implementation Complete!

## Quick Summary

Your GoGrub app now fetches products from your database instead of static arrays. Products automatically display in the correct category based on the `category` field in your database.

## ✅ What's Done

### Files Created:
1. ✅ `.env` - Backend API URL configuration
2. ✅ `src/services/api.js` - API service layer for backend communication

3. ✅ `src/Contexts/storeContext.js` - Now fetches from database, filters by category
4. ✅ `src/categories/Delightmeals.js` - Loading/error states added
5. ✅ `src/categories/Fastfood.js` - Loading/error states added
6. ✅ `src/categories/Snacks.js` - Loading/error states added
7. ✅ `src/Components/Shopping.js` - Loading/error states added
8. ✅ `GGbackend/server.js` - CORS updated for frontend
